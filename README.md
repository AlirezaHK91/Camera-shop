# Simple School Project (Camera-shop)

This project entails the development of a straightforward website by CSS, HTML, JavaScript. Users have the ability to select items and add them to a shopping cart. Moreover, they can adjust the quantity of the selected items and view the total price of the products in their cart.

## Features
- Hamburger menu for small screens
- Choose and add items to the cart
- Modify item quantities
- View total price in the cart

## Sign-in and Login Page

I've also included a sign-in and login page, although they currently lack functional capabilities.
